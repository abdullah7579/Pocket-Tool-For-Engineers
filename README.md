Developed a Digital Systems Assistance (DSA) tool designed to streamline essential calculations and operations for electrical engineers, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in circuit analysis and troubleshooting. 

The tool's key features include:
Number System Conversion: Efficiently convert between decimal and binary using recursive algorithms.
Resistor Configuration Conversion: Perform Delta-to-Wye and Wye-to-Delta resistor configuration conversions for circuit analysis.
Resistor Value Verification: Calculate resistance values and tolerances based on color codes.
Circuit Analysis: Compute Norton and Thevenin equivalents for simplifying electrical circuits.
Error Detection: Generate and verify Hamming codes for robust error detection and correction.
User-Friendly Interface: A menu-driven interface for seamless navigation and interaction.
History Management: Log results for easy retrieval and reference.
The project utilized C++ and leveraged efficient data structures like stacks, vectors, and arrays to optimize performance. Future enhancements include integrating simulation capabilities, mobile application development, and cloud-based synchronization.
